				<p> 
					Sentence<br>
					Usually when reading a sentence or paragraph, the words within the sentence will become jumbled around, ending up out of order. This makes it so I have to reread a sentence multiple times until I understand it. This also makes it so I have to read much slower, so that fewer words in the sentence become jumbled up.<br>
					Word<br>
					When reading similar words, they tend to get switched in my head constantly. Similar words are always substituting for one another in my head. Simple words like "does" become "goes" or "and" becomes "an" or "land." <br>
					Letter<br>
					Just like words, letters that look or sound similar in my head will switch with each other. When I'm reading, instead of seeing a P or a G, I might see a Q or a J.<br>
					Overload<br>
					Reading for long amounts of time is something that I cannot do. Because of the difficulty I have with reading, I can only read in short segments without becoming flustered and getting a headache. The reason the text becomes a bright yellow is to help simulate how overwhelming and flustering reading can be sometimes for me. Try reading the entire paragraph without feeling flustered.<br>
